		  communicative, dynamical, and evolving system. ``Our

		  science, and much of what is called poetics and literary

		  the sciences and arts as they are practiced and theorized
		  today is exactly that science is conducted in a context
		  assumed to be manifest, fixed, and interesting, whereas the
