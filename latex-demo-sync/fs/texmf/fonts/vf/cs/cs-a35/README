Virtual font files from cspsfonts package  
-----------------------------------------
Petr Olsak, 2012

These metrics implement Caps&SmallCaps shape of \rm and \bf variants 
of Adobe35 fonts in IL2 (alias 8z) encoding.

They was generated from AFM files of URW fonts, see
doc/cstex/cspsfonts-gen/. They are mapped to the ptmr8z-like metrics
installed in tfm/cs-a35 and map/cs-a35-*.map files.
