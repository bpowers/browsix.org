tfm files from cspsfonts package  
--------------------------------
Petr Olsak, 2012

These metrics implement text variants of Adobe35 fonts in IL2 (alias 8z)
encoding.

They was generated from AFM files of URW fonts, see
doc/cstex/cspsfonts-gen/.

The metrics of ZapfDingbats and Symbol fonts are not here, because they are
not encoding-specific. You can find the metrics pzdr.tfm, psyr.tfm at another
place in your TeX distribution.
